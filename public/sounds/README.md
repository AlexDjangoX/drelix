# Luna hover sound

Add a short audio file here named **`luna-hover.mp3`** to play when the mouse moves over the Luna photo on the admin page.

**Suggestions:**

- **Cat meow** – fits the Luna mascot (e.g. search “short meow” on [Freesound](https://freesound.org) or [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/meow/)).
- **Chime / sparkle** – matches the confetti (e.g. “magic chime”, “sparkle”).
- **Soft pop or blip** – subtle celebration sound.

Keep it short (around 0.5–1.5 seconds) so repeated hovers still feel good.  
If the file is missing, the hover will still work (confetti only); the code ignores play errors.
